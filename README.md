## Design-and-Analysis-of-Advanced-Algos
The task is to implement a dynamic - programming solution to predict the secondary structure of RNA molecule given a nucleotide sequence. and vizualise it.
## RNA
RNA is a basic biological molecule. It is single stranded.
RNA molecules fold into complex secondary structures.
Secondary structure often governs the behaviour of an RNA molecule.
Various rules govern secondary structure formation:

Pairs of bases match up; each base matches with  1 other base.
Adenine always matches with Uracil.
Cytosine always matches with Guanine.
There are no kinks in the folded molecule.
Structures are knot-free.
